# Android-USB-Flasher
A flasher that works similar to Odin, but allows root capibilties and modifying the firmware in the file(s) by the USB cable.
# Android-USB-Flasher-Root
The "root" capibilties are in the home screen of the program. Just read the docs before using the tool.
# Read Before Flashing !!
If you flash the wrong firmware file or PIT (Partition Identification Table), then you can brick your device. If your device is bricked then create a discussion and provide photos and videos and other useful Odin Mode info you can possibly include.
Also be sure to unlock the devices' bootloader before repartitioning, because the device will brick itself unless you HAVE unlocked the BL (bootloader).
